# Notes

pwd --> print working directory (displays the current directory)

cd "path" ---> change directory (to navigate through the directories)

.. --> one level above the current directory

ls --> list the files and folders in the current directory

mkdir "dirname"--> create a new directory

touch "filename"--> create a new file

cat "absolute/relative filepath"--> prints the contents of a file

vi ---> vim command (lets you edit files.) {
    vi "filename" --> opens the file (can't modify anything just yet)

    Go to insert mode in order to write (press i)

    Make the changes.

    After writing, Press Esc to get out of the insert mode.

    type ":q!" to exit.

    ":wq!" to save and exit.
}

mv "file/folder to be moved" "destination" --> move the file/folder from one directory to another

cp "file/folder to be copied" "destination" ---> copies the file from one directory to another (only files can be copied, not directories)

cp -r "folder to be copied" "destination" --> -r ==> recursively copies one folder into another.
